            My first Job after moving back to saint Louis was MOD pizza. 
            I worked in the Chesterfield location and at the time MOD 
            was a new company. I was a part of the first crew. 
            It was a learning expierence and I learned 
            how things go from concepts to reality. 
            I worked here for about a year before I moved on.

            My next Job was Imo's Pizza, it was far more laid back, 
            but understaffed and consistantly more busy. It was very low skill
            and I believe the biggest skill I gained was learning to deal with stress 
            and work with difficult people.

            <br>
            The job I gained the most expierence at was the Melting Pot. 
            Here I became a manager of what was percieved to be a "Higher Class"
            restuarant.In reality (outside of the head chef), majority of employees
            had no formal training. I did learn a lot on the job and was able to manage a kitchen,
            I was able to keep servers and cooks on the same page while making the entrees. 
            This job really increased my people skills and I enjoyed my 3 years there.

            I joined Capitol Logisitcs, when I was ready to leave the food industry.
            Capitol Logistics, delivered packages for amazon and that was my original position, delivery driver.
            I did that for year, until management began trusting me with more task, such as taking the van to be repaired.
            then I began dispatching and whatever else was asked of me. I had plans to go into management, but then I got this opportunity from Launchcode.
            Hopefully the next thing I add to my list is Software Developer.
